### Logstash Filters

```
The contents of this files location are filter instructions for Losgstash.
Filter files are static on contents and once proven to be as required should not change as this will affect how the logs are presented in the search engine.

As there are probably 1000s of log filters available the number of files here will increase over time.

The provided syslog filter should be very static.
The provided jenkins filter is just meant as an example, please amend as required:  https://gist.github.com/evilchili/7046534

( oh and watch the spacing!!! )


As it seams that the config files are loaded by numeric order, make sure input is first, output is last and filters in between those two.
