### Logstash Filters

```
The contents of this files location are filter instructions for Losgstash.
Filter files are static on contents and once proven to be as required should not change as this will affect how the logs are presented in the search engine.

As there are probably 1000s of log filters available the number of files here will increase over time.

The provided syslog filter should be very static.
The provided jenkins filter is just meant as an example, please amend as required:  https://gist.github.com/evilchili/7046534

Hint:  save the individual filter here, then merge the filter into the donf file to be deployed - TEST it first though ...

( oh and watch the spacing!!! )
